# Behavior Prediction Model Codebase
Under code/ is the model source code, as well as a training script.
The IPython notebook contains our experimental results.
The .pkl files hold latent variable probabilities post-filtering for the different methods.

Included is also a trained model (the .pt file).

To run the evidential filtration post hoc on the behavior prediction task, within "code/dst/" run "run_dst.py".
